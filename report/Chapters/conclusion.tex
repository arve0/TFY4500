\chapter{Conclusion}
High quality images of collagen fiber has been collected in a structured fashion which may be used for further collection of data. Techniques for analysing the fiber orientation have been tested out. For further work, it is suggested that one should improve collection of images by using Computer Assisted Scanning, to make the collection more time efficient. For analysis it is suggested that one do machine learning on a large data set and try to predict outcome of patients.
